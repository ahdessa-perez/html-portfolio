<h1>The Best Movies According to Ahdessa</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
<p>Anime Movie that made me cry. <br />
    Grave of the Fireflies is based on the short story of the same name by novelist Akiyuki Nosaka, 
    who lived through the bombing of Kobe while he was a child. 
    He lost two sisters to malnutrition, and his adoptive father was also killed. 
    Nosaka reportedly spent the rest of his life wrestling with guilt over their deaths.

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
    There is never a scene that feels like it was made only for children. 
    The dialogue, the humor, and the characters all display a unique sense of realism 
    and maturity that normally isn't present in animated movies, 
    especially those made by Disney.

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>
    Howl's Moving Castle is a brilliant flight of imaginative fantasy. 
    The hand-drawn animation is visually spectacular and the imagery teeters between nightmarish horror 
    and haunting beauty. There are powerful philosophical messages about pacifism, youth, beauty, love and compassion.
